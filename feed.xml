                <p>Namaste!</p>
<p>From Today! I am going to a self improvement journey. I am going to do meditation, exercise, daily journaling and self care everyday. I am going to leave watching porn, movies and playing video games. I might also join the taekwondo club. I will definitely take care of my body and my mental health. I will become the best version of my life.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
