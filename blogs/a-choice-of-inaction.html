    <h1>A choice of inaction</h1>
    <p>I am a very indecive person. I cannot decide what is right for me and what is wrong. The time it takes for me to make decision far outweighs the other things in my life. I am still very young and naive. The act of choosing makes me so parallized that sometimes I just choose to not take any action.</p>
    <p>Thinking logically, I should work on the things that have not been done yet. But, I have to decide whether to do it or not and do i have the time, energy and motivation to do so. This makes many things in my life difficult (at least to me). I am very young and yet have no energy and motivation. I do not get interested in things easily.</p>
    <p>This might be the symptoms of depression, but, even then, I do not behave like a depressed person. I live a happy and normal life, just that, I sometimes have downtime like any person in the world does.So, I think I don't have any type of depression.</p>
